# FileSorter


Sure, here is a simplified version of the instructions on how to start the File Sorter:

To use the File Sorter:

Open a command prompt window.
Enter the following command, replacing <path to executable> with the actual path to the FileSorter.exe file and <path to base directory> with the path to the directory you want to sort:
<path to executable>\FileSorter.exe <path to base directory>
Example:

To sort all files in the directory C:\Temp, enter the following command:

C:\Temp\FileSorter.exe C:\Temp
If you encounter any errors, you can send me the log file on discord Jonnary.
